# First time for everything

I've been wanting to create a small website to journal and share some random information.

I looked at a couple of solutions in order to do so :

1.   [Standard React app](https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). 
2.   [Hugo (based on React)](https://gohugo.io/).
3.   [Fable with F#](https://fable.io/).
4.   [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

I've built a standard __React__ app with an __ASP.NET Core__ backend for a previous startup project I worked in but it felt like too much just for the sake of deploying a small blog project.
__Hugo__ seems like a great fit, and is definitely something I should consider as it's React based, but I don't feel like learning a whole new framework (maybe I'm just too lazy?). __Fable__ on the other hand is something I'm keeping my eyes on, and hopefully will eventually migrate to when I have more time as I'm really fond of the [F#](https://fsharp.org/) language. It will equally serve as a great project to apply more functional patterns in my day to day programming.

Finally __Jekyll__ is the option I went for as it's perfectly integrates with [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), and there's a simple [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll). There's a tiny learning curve, and I'm completely unaccustomed with the Ruby language, but after downloading a few themes, you quickly get the idea of how the website is setup. Most importantly, once everything is set in stone, you just have to add posts in a specific *_folder* in a markdown format. Bonus point, you even get $$LateX$$ formatting with MathJax!

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
$$

Anyhoo, this is the first post to many more to come. Enjoy !
